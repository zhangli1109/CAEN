Description:  With the development of high-throughput techniques, 
     more and more gene expression analysis tend to replace 
     hybridization-based microarrays with the revolutionary 
     technology.The novel method encodes the category again by 
     employing the rank of samples for each gene in each class. 
     We then consider the correlation coefficient of gene and class 
     with rank of sample and new rank of category. The highest 
     correlation coefficient genes are considered as the feature 
     genes which are most effective to classify the samples.
